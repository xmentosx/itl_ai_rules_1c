# OpenSpec bundle — snapshot of `openspec init` output

This folder ships a per-tool snapshot of the artifacts that the official OpenSpec CLI (`@fission-ai/openspec`) generates on `openspec init`: slash commands / workflows and SKILL packages for `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`, `/opsx:explore`.

- One subfolder per supported tool (`cursor/`, `claude-code/`, `codex/`, `opencode/`, `kilocode/`); each mirrors the exact relative paths the CLI writes into a project (e.g. `cursor/.cursor/commands/opsx-apply.md`). The installer copies a tool's subtree verbatim during `init` / `add` / `update` — see `AGENT-INSTALL.md → Place / Shared OpenSpec scaffold`. Note: the Kilo Code subtree keeps the upstream `.kilocode/workflows/` layout; current Kilo Code auto-migrates it to `.kilo/commands/` on startup.
- `version.txt` — the OpenSpec CLI version the snapshot was generated from; recorded in `.ai-rules.json` under `integrations.openspec.artifactsBundleVersion` on install.
- Codex ships SKILLs only (no project slash commands); the `other` adapter has no bundle — see `README.md → OpenSpec`.

To refresh the snapshot to a newer OpenSpec CLI version, run `tools/refresh-openspec-bundle.ps1` (maintainer machine; requires Node.js + the globally installed OpenSpec CLI) and review the diff — the script re-runs `openspec init` per tool and refreshes `version.txt` itself. Do not hand-edit the generated files — they are overwritten on the next refresh.
